# admin authentication module.

# this is not finished yet, so don't use it unless you're happy to play around with it
# if you have modules to contribute, send them to phplist2@tincan.co.uk
# the default module is phplist_auth.inc, which you can find in the "auth" subdirectory of the
# admin directory. It will tell you the functions that need to be defined for phplist to
# retrieve it's information.
# phplist will look for a file in that directory, or you can enter the full path to the file

# stacked attribute selection
# this is a new method of making a selection of attributes to send your messages to
# to start with, it doesn't seem to work very well in Internet Explorer, but it works fine
# using Mozilla, Firefox, Opera (haven't tried any other browsers)
# so if you use IE, you may not want to try this.

# stacked attribute selection allows you to continuously add a selection of attributes
# to your message. This is quite a bit more powerful than the old method, but it can also
# cause very complex queries to be constructed that may take too long to calculate
# If you want to try this, set the value to 1, and give us feedback on how it's going

# the timeout for refetching a URL can be defined here. When the last time a URL has been
# fetched exceeds this time, the URL will be refetched. This is in seconds, 3600 is an hour

# and then waiting for the next period. This only works with mailqueue_throttle off
# it still needs tweaking, so send your feedback to mantis.tincan.co.uk if you find
# any issues with it
